## Markdown is used for writing.

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Draw a text table and it becomes a html table.

| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |



If you want spesific alignment use colons within the header row on the side you want to align to.

```md
| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -------------:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600         |
```
