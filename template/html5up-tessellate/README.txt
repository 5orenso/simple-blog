This is Tessellate, a brand new responsive site template by AJ (aka n33) for HTML5 UP.
It's a single pager (a format I'm pretty into right now), has styling for a crapload
of basic elements, and includes a handy "dark" modifier class to flip a given element
to a light-on-dark color scheme.

Demo images* courtesy of Felicia Simion, a highly creative photographer/artist
friend of mine over at deviantART. See more of her incredible work here:
