## A very simple blog server

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/5orenso/simple-blog.svg?branch=master)


Written in Node.js with support for Markdown files, images, embedded content and all other stuff you would expect from a blog.

Base idea of this server is to keep it as lean as possible. There should be no hard admin interface or other stuff getting in the way of publishing content.

## This is how it works

```
    ----------------   dropbox      -------------
   | who-am-i.md    |  auto sync   | Simple blog |
   | hello-blog.md  | -----------> | server      |
   | ...            |              | (Amazon)    |  web page    ------------
    ----------------               |             | ----------> | browser    |
    ----------------   dropbox     |             |             |            |
   | image.jpg      |  auto sync   |             |              ------------
   | image2.jpg     | -----------> |             |
    ----------------               |             |
                                    -------------
    
```

- All content is worked on locally on your computer, phone og tablet. You can even work when offline.
- Everything is synced to the server by your Dropbox setup.

## Blog posts are separated into sections. 

Possible sections are:

|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------
| title     | :title     | :title My title  | Title of the blog post.
| teaser    | :teaser    |                  | Teaser text used on the frontpage and on the very top.
| ingress   | :ingress   |                  | Blog intro. The start of the blog post. Keep it relatively short.
| body      | :body      |                  | The blog post. 
| img       | :img       | :img photo1.jpg  | Standard images used in the blog. It depends on the template where they are placed. You may use 
| aside     | :aside     |                  | Boxes with content to go on the right side of the blog post.
| tags      | :tags      | :tags foo,bar    | Content tag for this blog post.


## Special tags

| Tag name  | Tag          | Example of usage | Description 
|-----------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------
| toc       | [:toc]       | [:toc]           | Automatic generated table of contents.
| fact      | [:fact file] | [:fact about-md] | A general fact box. This is usually shared between several blog posts.


### Example blog post
```md
 :title My blog post title
 :teaser Read all about it!
 :body
 ## Hello world!
 
 This is my first blog post.
 
```

__That's all there is to it.__


## Markdown is used for writing.

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
