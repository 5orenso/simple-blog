## A very simple blog server

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/5orenso/simple-blog.svg?branch=master)

Written in Node.js with support for Markdown files, images, embedded content and all other stuff you would expect from a blog.

Base idea of this server is to keep it as lean as possible. There should be no hard admin interface or other stuff getting in the way of publishing content.

## This is how it works

```
    ----------------   dropbox      -------------
   | who-am-i.md    |  auto sync   | Simple blog |
   | hello-blog.md  | -----------> | server      |
   | ...            |              | (Amazon)    |  web page    ------------
    ----------------               |             | ----------> | browser    |
    ----------------   dropbox     |             |             |            |
   | image.jpg      |  auto sync   |             |              ------------
   | image2.jpg     | -----------> |             |
    ----------------               |             |
                                    -------------    
```

- All content is worked on locally on your computer, phone og tablet. You can even work when offline.
- Everything is synced to the server by your Dropbox setup.
- Administration of users is done with your Dropbox sharing.

## Markdown is used for writing.

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
