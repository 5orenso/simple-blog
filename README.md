Written in Node.js with support for Markdown files, images, embedded content and all other stuff you would expect from a blog.

Base idea of this server is to keep it as lean as possible. There should be no hard admin interface or other stuff getting in the way of publishing content.

Search capabilities is added with an ElasticSearch integration adapter.

## This is how it works

```
    ----------------   dropbox      -------------     -------
   | who-am-i.md    |  auto sync   | Simple blog |   | Nginx |
   | hello-blog.md  | -----------> | server      |-->|   or  |
   | ...            |              | (Amazon)    |   | Cloud-|  web page    -----------
    ----------------               |             |   | Front | ----------> | browser   |
    ----------------   dropbox     |             |   |       |             | or mobile |
   | image.jpg      |  auto sync   |             |   |       |              -----------
   | image2.jpg     | -----------> |             |   |       |
    ----------------               |             |    -------
                                    -------------
    ----------------                      |
   | ElasticSearch  | --------------------
    ----------------

## Markdown is used for writing.

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
